# Python3 Sample Build application



# What is python3 good at compare to other lanaguages?

Python is a powerful programming language with a wide range of applications. Some areas where Python is particularly good at compared to other languages include:

- Data Science and Machine Learning: Python is widely used for data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. Its rich set of libraries and frameworks like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch make it easy to work with large datasets and build complex machine learning models.

- Web Development: Python is also a popular choice for web development. Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build scalable and robust web applications.

- Automation: Python is often used for automation tasks such as web scraping, data cleaning, and file management due to its simplicity and ease of use.

- Scripting: Python is a great language for writing small scripts that automate tasks and simplify processes.

- Rapid Prototyping: Python’s simple syntax and quick development cycles make it ideal for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

Overall, Python’s flexibility, ease of use, and large community of developers make it a great choice for a wide range of applications.

# Best practices to build and unit test python3

Here are some best practices for building and unit testing Python3 code:

- Use a virtual environment: Set up a virtual environment for your project to avoid version conflicts with other Python packages on your system.

- Write modular and reusable code: Write functions and classes that are modular and reusable. This will make your code more maintainable and easier to test.

- Follow the PEP 8 style guide: Adhering to the PEP 8 style guide will make your code more readable and consistent.

- Write docstrings: Document your code using docstrings to make it easier for others to understand and use.

- Use a linter: Use a linter such as pylint or flake8 to check your code for errors and adherence to best practices.

- Write unit tests: Write unit tests for each function and class in your code to ensure that they behave as expected. Use a testing framework such as pytest or unittest to make writing and running tests easier.

- Use Continuous Integration (CI): Set up a CI pipeline to automatically run your tests whenever code is pushed to your repository. This will help catch errors early and ensure that your code is always in a working state.

- Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to manage your code and collaborate with others. This will make it easier to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your Python3 code is maintainable, testable, and of high quality.

# SonarQube usage example for python3

SonarQube is a popular tool for analyzing code quality and identifying potential issues in code. Here is an example of how to use SonarQube for a Python3 project:

1. Install and start SonarQube: Follow the installation instructions on the SonarQube website to install and start the SonarQube server.

1. Install the SonarQube Scanner: Install the SonarQube Scanner for your platform. This will allow you to analyze your Python3 code and send the results to the SonarQube server.

1. Configure the SonarQube Scanner: Create a configuration file for the SonarQube Scanner that specifies the location of your source code and the location of the SonarQube server. The file should also include any additional configuration options you want to use, such as rules for the quality profile.

1. Run the SonarQube Scanner: Use the SonarQube Scanner to analyze your Python3 code. The scanner will generate a report that includes information on code coverage, code duplication, and other quality metrics.

1. View the results in SonarQube: Once the scan is complete, you can view the results in the SonarQube dashboard. This will show you any issues that were found in your code, such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

1. Take action on the issues: Use the information in the SonarQube report to identify and fix any issues in your Python3 code. You can also configure SonarQube to send notifications when new issues are found, to help ensure that your code quality remains high.

1. By using SonarQube to analyze your Python3 code, you can identify potential issues early in the development process and take action to improve the overall quality of your code.

# How to build and unit test python3 with setup.py and setup.cfg

setup.py and setup.cfg are two files that are commonly used in Python3 projects to define the package metadata and configuration options for the package. Here's an overview of how to use each file:

## setup.py:
setup.py is a Python script that contains the metadata for the package, such as the package name, version, author, and license. It is used by tools like pip to install and distribute packages.

Here's an example setup.py file:

from setuptools import setup, find_packages
```python
setup(
    name='my_package',
    version='1.0.0',
    author='John Smith',
    author_email='john@example.com',
    description='A simple Python package',
    packages=find_packages(),
    classifiers=[
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
    ],
)
```
In this example, we define the package metadata such as the package name, version, author, description, and classifiers. We also use the find_packages() function to automatically find all the Python packages in the current directory.

## setup.cfg:
setup.cfg is a configuration file that can be used to define the configuration options for the package. It is an alternative to using command-line arguments when running the setup.py script.

Here's an example setup.cfg file:


```makefile
[metadata]
name = my_package
version = 1.0.0
author = John Smith
author_email = john@example.com
description = A simple Python package

[options]
packages = find:
install_requires =
    numpy>=1.18.0
    pandas>=1.0.0
```
In this example, we define the same package metadata as in the setup.py example, but we also use the [options] section to specify the package dependencies using the install_requires option.

# how to setup pytest in setup.py and setup.cfg, and why it is important

Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python projects. It allows you to write tests for your code in a concise and expressive way, and provides many powerful features for test discovery, execution, and reporting.

Setting up pytest in your project involves adding it as a dependency in your setup.py file, and configuring it in your setup.cfg file. Here's how to do it:

Add pytest as a dependency in setup.py:
```python
setup(
    name='myproject',
    ...
    install_requires=[
        'pytest',
        ...
    ],
    ...
)
```
Configure pytest in setup.cfg:
```ini

[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests
addopts = --cov=myproject --cov-report=html
```
Here, we're telling pytest to look for tests in the 'tests' directory, and to enable coverage reporting with the --cov and --cov-report options. You can customize these settings to suit your project's needs.

So why is it important to set up pytest in your project? Here are a few reasons:

- Testing is an essential part of software development, and pytest makes it easy to write and run tests for your Python code.
- By setting up pytest in your project's configuration files, you ensure that anyone who clones your repository can easily run the tests and get the same results.
- Configuring pytest with options like coverage reporting can help you identify areas of your code that need more testing, and ensure that your tests are providing adequate coverage.
- Using a popular testing framework like pytest can make it easier for other developers to contribute to your project, since they'll be familiar with the tools and conventions you're using.
